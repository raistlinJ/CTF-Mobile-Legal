# Privacy Policy

**App:** CTF Mobile Manager  
**Effective date:** December 20, 2025

This app is an administrative client for a CTFd server (Capture The Flag platform). It connects to a CTFd instance you configure and displays/updates CTF-related data.

## Data we process

- **Account / authentication data:** If you sign in with a username/password or API token, the app uses those credentials to authenticate to your CTFd server.
- **CTF content and user data from your server:** The app retrieves and displays CTFd data such as users/teams, challenges, submissions, and scoreboard information, depending on your permissions.

## Data stored on your device

- **Optional Keychain storage:** If you enable “Save … in Keychain”, the app stores your token and/or credentials securely in the iOS Keychain to support quick sign-in and Face ID unlock.
- **App settings:** Basic settings such as the server base URL and user preferences may be stored locally (e.g., via UserDefaults).

## Data we do not collect

- **No third-party analytics/ads SDKs:** The app does not include analytics or advertising SDKs by default.
- **No tracking:** The app does not use IDFA or track you across apps and websites.

## Where data goes

Network requests are sent only to the CTFd server you configure. The operator of that server (often you/your organization) may log requests and activity according to that server’s policies and hosting provider.

## Security

The app uses Apple system frameworks for secure local storage (Keychain) and biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID). You are responsible for the security configuration of your CTFd server.
