  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>App:</strong> CTF Mobile Manager</p>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 20, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This app is an administrative client for a CTFd server (Capture The Flag platform). It connects to a CTFd instance you configure
    and displays/updates CTF-related data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data we process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account / authentication data:</strong> If you sign in with a username/password or API token, the app uses those credentials to authenticate to your CTFd server.</li>
    <li><strong>CTF content and user data from your server:</strong> The app retrieves and displays CTFd data such as users/teams, challenges, submissions, and scoreboard information, depending on your permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data stored on your device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optional Keychain storage:</strong> If you enable “Save … in Keychain”, the app stores your token and/or credentials securely in the iOS Keychain to support quick sign-in and Face ID unlock.</li>
    <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Basic settings such as the server base URL and user preferences may be stored locally (e.g., via UserDefaults).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data we do not collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No third-party analytics/ads SDKs:</strong> The app does not include analytics or advertising SDKs by default.</li>
    <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> The app does not use IDFA or track you across apps and websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where data goes</h2>
  <p>
    Network requests are sent only to the CTFd server you configure. The operator of that server may log
    requests and activity according to that server’s policies and hosting provider.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses Apple system frameworks for secure local storage (Keychain) and biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID).
    You are responsible for the security configuration of your CTFd server.
